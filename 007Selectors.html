        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
        <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
        <p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
        <p>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</p>
        <p>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</p>
        <p>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</p>
        <p>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</p>
        <p>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</p>
